# all-contributors-patch
An extension that patches a bug with titles of generated emojis, by the `all-contributors-cli`. It's just impossible to handle it in another way, because of the GitHub. Basically it is just a 3 lines of code.

## Install
Since I don't have account on Chrome Web Store you are free to publish it. Otherwise:

1. Clone the repo
2. Open `chrome://extensions`
3. Click "Developer Mode" toggle button
4. Click "Load unpacked" tab and select the folder of the repository.
5. That's it! :)

Soon more stable repository, sorry! :)
